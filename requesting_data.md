# Requesting Data from SWITRS

To request data from the California Highway Patrol, go to the
[Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System
(SWITRS) website](http://iswitrs.chp.ca.gov/Reports/jsp/userLogin.jsp) and
register an account. When your account is registered and activated, login and
click "Raw Data" on the left hand sidebar, as circled below:

Fill in the form that comes up. Make sure to fill in the "Reporting Period
Start" and the "Reporting Period End" fields and check the "Headers" box. When
you are done hit "Generate Report". These fields are boxed in red below:

The CHP will email you when your report is ready for
download, which normally takes a few days. The download will give you a large
zip file which you must unzip before using SWITRS-2-SQLite.
